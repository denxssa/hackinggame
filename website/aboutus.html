            <p>
                We are two Computer Science students who grew together, fueled by a passion for coding, 
                problem-solving, and the digital frontier. The idea for this hacker tool/game project 
                sparked from our late-night study sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project is a testament to our ongoing journey in Computer Science.
